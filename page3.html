            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">"People are not good at securing their keys," said Bryan Bishop, a longtime bitcoin developer. "To the extent that we can write software better and secure [bitcoin] better, that's a win.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">As CoinDesk previously reported, the idea of a bitcoin vault has been around since 2016. The original proposal required a hard fork that core developers never implemented.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">But as of today, Bishop is rolling out a fork-free prototype on GitHub and sharing it out over the Bitcoin Core email list.&nbsp;</span><div>
<span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The basic idea involves storing bitcoin (BTC) on-chain in a particularly secure manner that allows for recovery from security mistakes. The on-chain approach is part of what makes Bishop's vault distinct from a cold wallet. &nbsp;</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;"><strong>How it works
</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The thing about a normal wallet is you only have your own security model to protect you. If someone gets your private key, you have no recourse.
&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Vaults, as proposed by Bishop and others, offer a Plan B. If your security falters somehow, you have a clawback mechanism.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">
</span><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Users of such vaults would effectively be deciding to limit the pace at which their bitcoin (BTC) could be released in the event of a breach. The stored bitcoin would be divided into a series of what Bishop is calling "shards." These shards could only release their bitcoin to a hot wallet one at a time at some pre-set interval.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">The proposal also calls for something called a watchtower which would monitor vaults. Any time it saw BTC move from a shard, it would likely notify the owner. If the attempt to transfer the bitcoin had not been authorized, the user could activate a pre-signed transaction that would move all the BTC to an off-chain cold wallet, before the bitcoin could unlock for use by the attacker.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Under certain conditions, the watchtower might skip the notification step and simply initiate moving to the cold wallet anyway.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">
</span><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">"To operate this vault and everything that runs with it will require software at a minimum. This is not a manual procedure," Bishop said. It's not yet clear whether users would run their own watchtowers or if that will need to be something that's shared by users.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Cornell professor and Ava Labs founder Emin GÃ¼n Sirer was part of the team that proposed bitcoin vaults back in 2016. He told CoinDesk he's been watching Bishop's work closely. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.4rem;">"It's fantastic to see vaults go from concept to reality," he told CoinDesk in an email. "We would like to see vaults become a standard feature on all cryptocurrencies, as they have the potential to avoid what are called 'Sorry For Your Loss (SFYL)' events."</span></div></div>
